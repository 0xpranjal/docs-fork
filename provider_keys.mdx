Have a custom model or voice with one of the providers? Or an enterprise account with volume pricing?

No problem! You can bring your own API keys to Vapi. You can add them in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) under the **Provider Keys** tab. Once your API key is validated, you won't be charged when using that provider through Vapi. Instead, you'll be charged directly by the provider.

## Transcription Providers

Currently, the only available transcription provider is `deepgram`. To use a custom model, you can specify the deepgram model ID in the `transcriber.model` parameter of the [Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).

## Model Providers

We are currently working on support for custom OpenAI and custom Azure OpenAI provider keys.

If more customization is needed, you can also set up your own [Custom LLM](/custom_llm) endpoint and use that instead.

## Voice Providers

All voice providers are supported. Once you've validated your API through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai), any voice ID from your provider can be used in the `voice.voiceId` field of the [Assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).
