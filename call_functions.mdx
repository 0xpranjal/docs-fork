Under the hood, Vapi assistants are given two additional functions: `transferCall` and `endCall`. These functions can be used to transfer and hang up calls, respectively.

You **do not** need to add these functions to your model's `functions` array.

#### Transfer Call

When a `forwardingPhoneNumber` is present on an assistant, the assistant will be given a `transferCall` function. This function can be used to transfer the call to the `forwardingPhoneNumber`.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "systemPrompt": "You are an assistant at a law firm. When the user asks to be transferred, use the transferCall function."
  },
  "forwardingPhoneNumber": "+16054440129"
}
```

#### End Call

This function is provided when `endCallFunctionEnabled` is enabled on the assistant. The assistant can use this function to end the call.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "systemPrompt": "You are an assistant at a law firm. If the user is being mean, use the endCall function."
  },
  "endCallFunctionEnabled": true
}
```

#### Dial Keypad

This function is provided when `dialKeypadFunctionEnabled` is enabled on the assistant. The assistant will be able to enter digits on the keypad.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "systemPrompt": "You are an assistant at a law firm. When you hit a menu, use the dialKeypad function to enter the digits."
  },
  "dialKeypadFunctionEnabled": true
}
```
