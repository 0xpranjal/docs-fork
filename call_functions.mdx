Under the hood, Vapi assistants are given two additional functions: `transferCall` and `endCall`. These functions can be used to transfer and hang up calls, respectively.

You **do not** need to add these functions to your assistant's `functions` array.

## Transfer Call

When a `forwardingPhoneNumber` is present on an assistant, the assistant will be given a `transferCall` function. This function can be used to transfer the call to the `forwardingPhoneNumber`.

```json
{
  "context": "You are an assistant at a law firm. When the user asks"
           + "to be transferred, use the transferCall function.",
  "voice": "steve-11labs",
  ...
}
```

## End Call

Both phone and web calls are provided this function. The assistant can use this function to end the call.

```json
{
  "context": "You are an assistant at a law firm. If the user isn't"
           + "taking the call seriously, use the endCall function.",
  "voice": "steve-11labs",
  ...
}
```
