<Card title="Voice AI Pricing That's Flexible and Transparent">
  We bill you for the Transcription and Voice services **at cost**. If you choose to go with a LLM
  we offer through the platform, you will be billed for the Model **at cost**.
  <Info>
    You also have the option of using [Provider Keys](/provider-keys); if you use a Provider Key for
    Transcription, Model, or Voice, you are not charged through the Vapi platform but are billed
    directly by the provider.
  </Info>
  **On top of what you are billed for providers, Vapi charges a base fee of $0.05 per minute.**
</Card>

<Accordion title="Billing">
  Billing occurs automatically based on the cost of the providers you choose. The only exception is
  for [Provider Keys](/provider-keys). When you use a Provider Key, you will be billed directly by
  the provider. <b /> You can find your usage and billing information in the
  [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

<Accordion title="Pricing Example 1">
  I want to use Vapi voice assistants to support my human customer service reps in a call center.
  However, I have a custom LLM I would prefer to use instead of the ones offered through the
  platform. Expected monthly usage will be 10,000 minutes, with an average of 2 minutes per call.
  For Voice, PlayHT will suit our needs. What is my pricing breakdown?
  <br />
  Transcription costs will be 0.01 per min. Since you will be using a custom LLM, there will be no
  charge for the Model. PlayHT for Voice will be 0.10 per minute. The Vapi base fee for using the
  platform will be 0.05 per minute. Here is your breakdown:
  <br />
  (Vapi: \$0.05 x 10000 x 2) + (Deepgram: \$0.01 x 10000 x 2) + (Model: \$0.00) + (PlayHT: \$0.10 x
  10000 x 2) <br /> Total cost per month to use the Vapi platform: $3,200
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pricing Example 2">
  I have a company that does real estate lead generation, and would like to use Vapi voice
  assistants to automate parts of my customer support process. These support calls would average 4.5
  minutes a call. For Model I want to use ChatGPT-3.5-turbo through your platform, and for Voice I
  will be using a Provider Key. Iâ€™d like a breakdown based on getting 100 inbound calls in one
  month.
  <br />
  Transcription costs will be 0.01 per min. For the Model, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo will be 0.02 per
  minute. Since for Voice you will be using a Provider Key, you will be billed directly by that
  provider and there will be no charge from Vapi. The Vapi base fee for using the platform will be
  0.05 per minute. Here is your breakdown:
  <br />
  (Vapi: \$0.05 x 100 x 4.5) + (Deepgram: \$0.01 x 100 x 4.5) + (Model: \$0.02 x 100 x 4.5) +
  (Voice: \$0.00) <br /> Total cost per month to use the Vapi platform: $36
