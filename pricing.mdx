<Card title="Platform Pricing">
Vapi integrates all of the services needed to build a voice assistant: transcription, model, and voice. Most of what you pay to use Vapi goes to these services. **You are only billed at cost for the service providers.** <br/> Your overall cost will vary depending on which model and voice provider you choose. On top of the provider costs, we charge a base fee of $0.05 per minute.

These costs are subject to change as we get more data, but they will always reflect our best estimate of our per minute. You can find your usage and billing information in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

<Accordion title="Billing">
Billing occurs automatically based on the cost of the providers you choose. The only exception is for [Provider Keys](/provider_keys). When you use a Provider Key, you will be billed directly by the provider.
