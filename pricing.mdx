The vast majority of the cost of using Vapi is the cost of the underlying providers. We charge a base fee on top of the provider cost to cover our costs and to be a sustainable business.

When using [Provider Keys](/provider_keys), you'll be billed directly by the provider, not us. When using providers through Vapi, you'll be billed at what we've estimated to be our average cost / min. It'll sometimes be cheaper through us too, since we get volume pricing.

Based on the providers you select and the keys you provide, you will be automatically billed per minute. You can see the pricing and options for each piece below:
