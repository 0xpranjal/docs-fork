<Accordion title="Building a Voice Assistant">
<Steps>
<Step title="First Step">
In the `Assistant` screen, select Create new assistant. Here, you can choose between three of our pre-built assistant templates, or create your own using a blank template. You’ll also have the option of naming your new assistant. Let’s proceed as if you’re creating your own.
</Step>
<Step title="Second Step">
You will now be able to see your new assistant under the Create new assistant button. This is also where your other assistants will be listed. If you wish to delete an assistant you’ve created, click on the trash icon next to the green Talk with New Assistant button. While we’re here, take a look above the green button under New Assistant. Here, you can copy the assistant ID, as well as two different demo links. 
</Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Now that your assistant has been created, it’s time to set it up. Take a look at the four options under the green button: Model, Voice, Functions, and Advanced. These are the main components. When you’re ready, click Publish and your selections will take effect. 
However, you can always come back and make changes.

**Model**
Choose the LLM Provider and specific Model you want to use for your assistant. There are several other fields here we’ll want to go ahead and cover.
- Temperature- Lets you control the randomness of your model’s output using a slider.
- Max Tokens- Max number of tokens the assistant can generate for each turn of the conversation. 
- First Message- The first message your assistant will say when receiving or making a call.
- System Prompt- This is where you input text that provides your assistant with information on context, role, personality, tasks, etc. 

**Voice**
Options for the voice your assistant will be using.
-  Language- We support multiple languages and accents, and are always adding more. Let us know if a language you need is not there and we’ll see if we can add it.<Info>For languages other than English, only the providers 11Labs and azure currently use correct pronunciation.</Info>
-  Provider and Present Voice Name- Select the service provider and the specific voices each one offers here.
- Enable Custom Voice- This lets you add a custom voice from 11Labs.

**Functions**
This is where you can enable any of our predefined Functions like End Call Phrases or allowing your assistant to dial digits on the keypad. 

**Advanced**
This is where you can opt out of summaries/transcription and recording, as well as input your Server URL.
</Step>

<Step title="Fourth Step">
Click the green Talk with New Assistant button to test and engage with the assistant you have just created and set up.

<Card title="Getting a Phone Number">
Now that your assistant is ready to go, it’s time to get a phone number. Select the `Phone Number` screen on the sidebar. Here, you can either purchase a number from us or import one from Twilio. Under these options you’ll see listed any other active phone numbers. On the right side of the screen, you will want to align the selected number with the desired assistant. Make sure to double-check this, as you don’t want the wrong assistant to engage inbound calls. 
<br />
We also support Vonage’s VoIP and UCaaS solutions for businesses. And keep in mind that you can test both inbound and outbound calling for your phone number via the dashboard. 
<br />
Now you’re ready to go! Give the phone number a call to test out your assistant and confirm that everything is operational.
