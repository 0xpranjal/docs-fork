<Accordion title="Couldn't I build this myself and save money?">
You could, but there are good reasons for not doing so. The vast majority of the cost to use Vapi is provider fees which you would have to incur anyway. While we do add on a small base fee, this is more than offset by the fact that we support and maintain the whole system, and continue to reduce latency and improve the conversational experience. You even have the option of bringing your own [Provider Keys](/provider_keys), and only paying us for the value we provide.

We specialize in Voice AI and it’s where we devote our time and resources, so we’ll always be leading the way. This lets you keep your focus on building exceptional products.

  <Accordion title="Sounds good, but I'm building a custom X for Y...">
    Not a problem. We can likely already support it. And, you can bring custom models for any part of the pipeline.
    
    If they're hosted with one of our providers, you just need to add your provider keys, then specify the custom model in your API request. If they are hosted elsewhere, you can use the `custom` provider and specify the [URL to your model](/custom_llm) in your API request.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it going to be hard to set up?">
    No. In fact, the setup could not be easier. All you need is one line to start a call via the API, or on any of our client libraries.

    For more advanced features like function calling, you have to set up a [Server URL](/server_url) to accept and respond to messages.
