<Steps>
  <Step title="Couldn't I build this myself and cut costs?">
    Yeah, but it won't be worth it. The vast majority of the cost is from the providers, not us. You can even bring your own [Provider Keys](/provider_keys) and only pay us for the value we provide.

    By specializing, we'll always be the best at this. So you can focus on making your product the best at what it does.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Okay, but I'm building a custom X for Y...">
    That's cool. There's a good chance we can support it. You can bring custom models for any part of the pipeline.
    
    If they're hosted with one of our providers, you just need to add your provider keys, then specify the custom model in your API request.

    If they're hosted elsewhere, you can use the `custom` provider and specify the [URL to your model](/custom_llm) in your API request.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Is it going to be hard to set up?">
    No, it's super easy. One line to start a call, via the API, or on any of our client libraries.

    For more advanced stuff like function calling, you just have to set up a [Server URL](/server_url) to accept and respond to messages.
