import ProvisionPhoneNumberWithVapi from "/snippets/quickstart/dashboard/provision-phone-number-with-vapi.mdx";

There are **2 ways** we can get a phone number into our Vapi account:

1. **Purchase a Number Through Vapi:** we can directly purchase phone numbers through Vapi.

   - Vapi will provision the phone number for us via Twilio
   - This can be done in the dashboard, or via the API (we will use the dashboard)

2. **Import from Twilio or Vonage:** if we already have a phone number with an external telephony provider (like Twilio or Vonage), we can import them into our Vapi account.

  <Accordion title="Import from Twilio or Vonage" icon="hashtag" iconType="regular">
    We can also import an existing phone number we already own with either Twilio or Vonage.

    For example's sake, we will proceed with [**Twilio**](https://twilio.com) (though the steps are the same for Vonage as
    well).

      <Accordion title="Buy a Phone Number via Twilio (optional)" icon="hashtag" iconType="solid">
        If you don't already have a number in Twilio, you can purchase one by going to your Twilio console's "Buy a number" section:

          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/buy-phone-number-twilio.png" />
        </Frame>

        Once you've purchased a number, it will immediately be ready for import into Vapi.

      <Accordion title="Locate Twilio Account SID & Auth Token" icon="key" iconType="solid">
        To complete the import on Vapi's side, we will need to grab our Twilio **"Account SID"** & **"Auth Token"**.

        You should see a section for "API keys & tokens", the credentials we will need for the import will live here.

        <Frame caption="We will want to navigate to the credentials section of our account.">
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/twilio-api-key-nav.png" />
        </Frame>

        Once we are in our "API keys & tokens" section, we will grab the Account SID & Auth Token:

        <Frame>
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/twilio-credentials.png" />
        </Frame>

        We will use both of these credentials in the next step of importing via the Dashboard.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Import via Dashboard" icon="v" iconType="solid">
        Navigate to the “Phone Numbers” section & click the “Import” button:

        <Frame caption="Click 'Import' in the 'Phone Numbers' tab of your dashboard.">
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/dashboard-import-phone-number.png" />
        </Frame>

        There you will input your phone number, as well as the credentials you retrieved in the previous step:

        <Frame >
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/import-twilio-number-dashboard.png" />
        </Frame>

        Hit "Import" & you will come to the phone number detail page:

        <Frame caption="The phone number detail page, we can configure our phone number here.">
          <img src="/static/images/quickstart/phone/phone-number-import-complete.png" />
        </Frame>

        Your number is now ready to be attached to an assistant for inbound or outbound phone calling.
