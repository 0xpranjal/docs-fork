**Assistant** is a fancy word for an AI configuration that can be used across phone calls and Vapi clients.

There are three core components: **Transcriber**, **Model**, and **Voice**. These can be configured, mixed, and matched for your use case. They also have a bunch of other configurable properties you can find [here](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).

### Persistant vs. Temporary Assistants

You might be wondering... should I create an assistant using the `/assistant` endpoint and use its `assistantId`? Or can I just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call?

**You might want to use temporary assistants when:**

- Your server is going to have its own properties on top of our assistants, and it's going to be a lot of work to keep them up to sync with ours.
- You want to frequently change the assistant properties across calls.

**You might want to use persistant assistants when:**

- You won't be building your own assistant properties on top of ours.
- You want to use the same assistant across multiple calls.
