**Assistant** is a fancy word for an AI configuration that can be used across phone calls and Vapi clients.

There are three core components: **Transcriber**, **Model**, and **Voice**. These can be configured, mixed, and matched for your use case. They also have a bunch of other configurable properties you can find [here](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant).
