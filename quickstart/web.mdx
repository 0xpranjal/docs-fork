## Vapi’s Pizzeria

We will be implementing a simple order-taking assistant at a pizza shop called “Vapi’s Pizzeria”.

Vapi’s has 3 types of menu items: `pizza`, `side`s, & `drink`s. Customers will be ordering 1 of each.

<Frame caption="Customers will order 3 items: 1 pizza, 1 side, & 1 drink. The assistant will handle the full order taking conversation.">
  <img src="/static/images/quickstart/vapis-pizzeria.png" />
</Frame>

### TODOs

There are 2 ways we can do this:

1. **Inline call:** we can start a web call in 1 function call w/ the Web SDK (passing [assistant](/assistants) configuration inline)
2. **Create an assistant, then call:** we can create a [persistent assistant](/persistent_assistants), then start a web call (with the assistant's ID)

In both cases, we will be using the [Web SDK](/sdk/web) to start a call.

## Starting a Web Call Inline (fastest)

First, we will look at starting a call inline, passing the assistant configuration directly to the Web SDKs `.start()` method.

### Setup

  <Accordion title="Install the Web SDK" icon="folder-arrow-down" iconType="solid">
    <InstallWebSDK />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import the Vapi Module" icon="brackets-curly" iconType="solid">
    <ImportWebSDK />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Making the Call

Now that we have the SDK code imported, we just have to call `.start()`, passing in our assistant configuration to begin the call.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assistant Configuration" icon="brackets-curly" iconType="solid">
    Here are the options we will pass to `.start()`:

    ```javascript
      const assistantOptions = {
        name: "Vapi’s Pizza Front Desk",
        firstMessage: "Vappy’s Pizzeria speaking, how can I help you?",
        transcriber: {
          provider: "deepgram",
          model: "nova-2",
          language: "en-US",
        },
        voice: {
          provider: "playht",
          voiceId: "jennifer",
        },
        model: {
          provider: "openai",
          model: "gpt-4",
          messages: [
            {
              role: "system",
              content: `You are a voice assistant for Vappy’s Pizzeria, a pizza shop located on the Internet.

      Your job is to take the order of customers calling in. The menu has only 3 types
      of items: pizza, sides, and drinks. There are no other types of items on the menu.

      1) There are 3 kinds of pizza: cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and vegetarian pizza
      (often called "veggie" pizza).
      2) There are 3 kinds of sides: french fries, garlic bread, and chicken wings.
      3) There are 2 kinds of drinks: soda, and water. (if a customer asks for a
      brand name like "coca cola", just let them know that we only offer "soda")

      Customers can only order 1 of each item. If a customer tries to order more
      than 1 item within each category, politely inform them that only 1 item per
      category may be ordered.

      Customers must order 1 item from at least 1 category to have a complete order.
      They can order just a pizza, or just a side, or just a drink.

      Be sure to introduce the menu items, don't assume that the caller knows what
      is on the menu (most appropriate at the start of the conversation).

      If the customer goes off-topic or off-track and talks about anything but the
      process of ordering, politely steer the conversation back to collecting their order.

      Once you have all the information you need pertaining to their order, you can
      end the conversation. You can say something like "Awesome, we'll have that ready
      for you in 10-20 minutes." to naturally let the customer know the order has been
      fully communicated.

      It is important that you collect the order in an efficient manner (succinct replies
      & direct questions). You only have 1 task here, and it is to collect the customers
      order, then end the conversation.

      - Be sure to be kind of funny and witty!
      - Keep all your responses short and simple. Use casual language, phrases like "Umm...", "Well...", and "I mean" are preferred.
      - This is a voice conversation, so keep your responses short, like in a real conversation. Don't ramble for too long.`,
            },
          ],
        },
      };
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start the Call" icon="play" iconType="solid">
    And here is how we start the call:

    ```javascript
    vapi.start(assistantOptions);
    ````

    <Accordion title="Allowing Microphone Access" icon="microphone" iconType="solid">
      The SDK will request access to your system's microphone, make sure you grant it.

      <Frame caption="Your browser may ask you for microphone permissions, make sure you grant them to the application.">
        <img src="/static/images/quickstart/web/microphone-permissions.png" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Breakdown

When we call `.start()` and pass an assistant configuration inline above, Vapi will do **2 things**:

1. **create an ephemeral assistant:** Vapi will conduct the call with an assistant as we configured (but [the assistant will not persist](/persistent_assistants) to your account)
2. **start a web call (w/ [Daily](https://www.daily.co))**: the SDK will start a realtime web call with bi-directional audio streaming

Let's look at each option we passed individually:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="name" icon="signature" iconType="solid">
    This is a display name for the assistant in our dashboard (for internal purposes only). This is an optional field.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="firstMessage" icon="message" iconType="light">
    This is the first message that our assistant will say when it picks up the web call.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="transcriber" icon="microphone" iconType="solid">
    The **transcriber** is what turns user speech into processable text for our LLM. This is the first step in the end-to-end voice pipeline.

    We are using [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) for transcription, specifically, their `Nova 2` model. We also set the language to be transcribed as English.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="voice" icon="person" iconType="solid">
    The final portion of the voice pipeline is turning LLM output-text into speech. This process is called "Text-to-speech" (or TTS for short).

    We use a voice provider called [PlayHT](https://play.ht), & a voice provided by them called `jennifer`.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="model" icon="microchip" iconType="solid">
    For our LLM, we use `gpt-4` (from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)) & set our system prompt for the assistant.

    The system prompt configures the context, role, personality, instructions and so on for the assistant.

    In our case, the system prompt above will give us the behaviour we want.

## Creating An Assistant Separately

Now that we know how to start an assistant call inline, lets look at separating the process of assistant creation & calling into **2 steps**.

Let's look at how we can create the same assistant "by hand" in the Vapi dashboard, then call it separately.

<Tip>
  Remember that we can also programmatically [create an
  assistant](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant) via the API.
</Tip>

### Assistant Creation

We will perform the same configuration of our assistant's **transcriber**, **model**, & **voice**.

<AssistantSetupInboundAccordionGroup />

### Calling Our Premade Assistant

Now that we have created our assistant, we just need to:

1. **copy the assistant ID** from the dashboard
2. **start a web call** with the assistant ID

<Accordion title="Copy Your Assistant ID" icon="fingerprint" iconType="solid">
  You can find your assistant's ID at the top of the assistant detail page:

  <Frame caption="Your assistant's identifier will look something like this.">
    <img src="/static/images/quickstart/assistant-id-dashboard.png" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

Now we can call `.start()`, passing the pre-made assistant's ID:

```javascript
vapi.start("79f3XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXce48");
```

This will have the same effect as what we did inline before, we just broke up the steps. Happy ordering!

<Tip>
  Your assistant won't yet be able to hang-up at the end of the call. We will learn more about
  configuring call end behaviour in later guides.
