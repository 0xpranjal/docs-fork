  <Accordion title="Sign Up">
    You can sign up [here](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) by entering an email and password, or by using Google OAuth. Once sign up is complete, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

From the Dashboard, you can create voice assistants, set up phone numbers, view your call history, and more.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add a Payment Method">
    Once you hit $10 in usage, your API calls will start throwing "Over Billing Limit". So, it's best to add a payment method before reaching that limit. This can be done in the **Billing** page in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

    Once your payment method is saved, you can increase your billing limit by increasing the  amount in the **Monthly Usage Limit** field.
</Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Use your API key">
    Your API key can be found in the **Account** page > Vapi Keys > Private API Key. When making requests to the API, make sure to include your key in the `Authorization` header.
    
    ```typescript
    const axios = require('axios');
    const API_KEY = 'your_api_key';

    const res = await axios.get('https://api.vapi.ai/assistant', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
      }
    });

    console.log(res.data);
    ```
</Accordion>
