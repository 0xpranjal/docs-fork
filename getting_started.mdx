## Signing Up

You can sign up [here](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) using the traditional method of email plus password or sign up using Google OAuth. Once you sign up, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

From the dashboard, you can create assistants, set up phone numbers, view your call history, and more. Your API keys can be found in the **Account** page.

## Creating an Assistant

`Assistant` is a fancy word for an AI configuration that can be used in both web and phone calls.

You can specify the assistant's voice, context, and other properties. You can use an assistant's `id` when creating a call or create a `PhoneNumber` that will use the assistant when receiving inbound calls.

## Set up a Phone Number

You can set up a phone number to place and receive phone calls. Phone numbers can be bought directly through Vapi or you use your own from Twilio. You can provide an `assistantId` to a phone number so that it will use the assistant when receiving inbound calls.

You can buy a phone number through the dashboard or use the [`/phone-numbers/buy`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/buy-phone-number)` endpoint.

If you want to use your own phone number, you can also use the dashboard or the [`/phone-numbers/import`](/api-reference/phone-numbers/verify-phone-number) endpoint. This will use your Twilio credentials to verify the number and configure it with Vapi services.

### Placing an Outbound Call

You can place an outbound call from one of your phone numbers using the [`/call/phone`](/api-reference/call/phone) endpoint. If the context will be different with every call, you can specify a temporary assistant in the `assistant` field. If you want to reuse an assistant, you can specify it's ID in the `assistantId` field.

## Set up the Web SDK

You can use the [Web SDK](https://github.com/VapiAI/web) to add Vapi assistants to your webapp. Just like with phone numbers, you can specify an assistant and provide functions it can use to interact with your server and/or webapp.
