    Once the sign up is finished, you will be redirected to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) where you can create your first asssistant within seconds. 

    To get you started we provide templates such as Custommer support, Inboound Q/A and Game NPC. If you wish to create your assistant from scratch you can select the blank template.

<Accordion title="Configuring your assistant">

    You can choose the LLM Provider and specific Model you want to use for your assistant. There are several other fields here we'll want to go ahead and cover.

**Model**

- Temperature- Lets you control the randomness of your model's output using a slider.
- Max Tokens- Max number of tokens the assistant can generate for each turn of the conversation. 
- First Message- The first message your assistant will say when receiving or making a call.
- System Prompt- This is where you input text that provides your assistant with information on context, role, personality, tasks, etc.

**Voice**
Options for the voice your assistant will be using.
-  Language- We support multiple languages and accents, and are always adding more. Let us know if a language you need is not there and we'll see if we can add it.<Info>For languages other than English, only the providers 11Labs and azure currently use correct pronunciation.</Info>
-  Provider and Present Voice Name- Select the service provider and the specific voices each one offers here.
-  Enable Custom Voice- This lets you add a custom voice from 11Labs.

**Functions**
This is where you can enable any of our predefined Functions like End Call Phrases or allowing your assistant to dial digits on the keypad. 


**Advanced**
This is where you can opt out of summaries/transcription and recording, as well as input your Server URL.

Now you're all set to test your voice assistant by initiating a phone call.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Make a phone call">

To make a phone call we have a few options:
- **Web calls:** This is the easiest way to test our voice assistant. You can use this option to make a call from your web application.
- **Buy phone number with Vapi:** You can visit [Phone numbers](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/phone-numbers) section to purchase a phone number. Vapi will charge a flat cost of $2.00 per month<Info>Currently, the functionality to buy phone numbers is only available for the US and Canada.</Info>
- **Import a phone number:** You can import your own phone number by using Twilio or Vonage
  - **Twilio:** You will need to enter your Phone number, Account SID, Auth token and assign it a label.
  - **Vonage:** You will need to enter your Phone number, API Key, API secret and assign it a label.


</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add a Payment Method">
    Once you hit $10 in usage, your API calls will start throwing "Over Billing Limit". So, it's best to add a payment method before reaching that limit. This can be done in the **Billing** page in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

    Once your payment method is saved, you can increase your billing limit by increasing the  amount in the **Monthly Usage Limit** field.
</Accordion>

   <Accordion title="Use your API key">
    Your API key can be found in the **Account** page > Vapi Keys > Private API Key. Click on the reveal buttton to reveal your private API key.

      <br />

  <br />  
    
    
    When making requests to the API, make sure to include your key in the `Authorization` header.
    
    ```typescript
    const axios = require('axios');
    const API_KEY = 'your_api_key';

    const res = await axios.get('https://api.vapi.ai/assistant', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
      }
    });

    console.log(res.data);
    ```
</Accordion>
