As part of the `Assistant`, you can optionally specify a `callbackUrl`. This is your server's URL that the assistant will use when retreiving context, performing function calls, and sending call summaries / recordings.

### Retreiving Context

This is for if you need to customize the assistant's context by retrieving it from your server. If `callbackUrl` is specified and `context` is not, the assistant will make a `GET` request to the `callbackUrl` with the `customerPhoneNumber` and `assistantId` as query parameters. Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the context, like so:

```json
{ "context": "You are an assistant at a law firm. You are calling to..." }
```

### Function Calling

Vapi fully supports [OpenAI's function calling API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling), so you can have assistants ping your server to perform actions like sending emails, retrieve information, and more. GPT-4 will automatically determine what functions to call based on the context you provide and the user's input.

If `functions` are defined on the assistant, it will use the `callbackUrl` to make a `POST` request with the following body:

<Snippet file="function.body.mdx" />

Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the function's response, like so:

```json
{ "result": "Your email has been sent." }
```

### Call Status Updates

During the call, the assistant will make multiple `POST` requests to the `callbackUrl` with the following body:

```json
{ "status": "started" }
```

The status events are:

- `started`: The call has started.
- `voicemail`: The call has been sent to voicemail.
- `transfer`: The call is about to be transferred.
- `ended`: The call has ended.

### End of Call Report

When a call ends, the assistant will make a `POST` request to the `callbackUrl` with the following body:

```json
{
  "transcript": "Hello there!...",
  "summary": "The assistant started the call by saying...",
  "recordingUrl": "https://vapi-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recordings/1234.mp3"
}
```
