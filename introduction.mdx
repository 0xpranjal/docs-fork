This guide will help you get started with Vapi. We will cover everything, starting with creating an account, creating an assistant, then we'll show you how to talk to it over the phone, on your website, in an iOS app, or a Python Script.

We'll also cover how to set up your assistant to perform custom tasks like fetching data, appointment booking, and more with Function Calling.
