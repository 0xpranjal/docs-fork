---

We built Vapi so you didn’t have to. Everything developers need to immediately begin building, testing, and deploying voicebots is here. 

<Accordion title="The Vapi API">
Build your own voice assistants, set up a phone number, place and receive calls, and more. <br /> Learn more about the API [here](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference/swagger).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Self-service Dashboard">
The Vapi [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) lets you build a voice assistant in a matter of minutes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Customizations and Integrations">

Vapi lets you use our voice assistants on every platform. For example, mobile app developers can use [Client SDKs](docs.vapi.ai/clients) to add a Vapi voice assistant to web apps and iOS apps. And we offer multiple ways to get under the hood and further customize your voice assistant, e.g., [Custom LLMs](docs.vapi.ai/custom_llm), more advanced [Call Functions](docs.vapi.ai/call_functions), and [Persistent Assistants](docs.vapi.ai/persistent_assistants).

## How it Works

<Card title="Who we are">
Think of Vapi as a Voice AI infrastructure that has already done the work of stitching together a pipeline for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and natural language. We connect with providers on your behalf, and support, maintain, and optimize everything so you don’t have to.  
</Card>

Let’s take a closer look at what Vapi does:

<Steps>
<Step title="Support and Optimization">
To provide you and your customers with a superior conversational experience, we have various latency optimizations like end-to-end streaming and colocating servers that shave off every possible millisecond of latency. We also manage the coordination of interruptions, turn-taking, and other conversational dynamics.
</Step>
<Step title="Customizable">
We built-in many smaller features to give developers a lot of room to customize and integrate. For example, there’s no need for you to hook up Twilio websockets or build bidirectional audio streaming. Instead, you can connect to the WebRTC stream through our [Web](https://github.com/VapiAI/web), [iOS](https://github.com/VapiAI/ios), or [Python](https://github.com/VapiAI/python) clients…and then get right back to what you were doing. 
</Step>
<Step title="Voice AI at Any Scale">
Finally, we designed Vapi to be highly scalable. We accommodate everything from small businesses and companies all the way up to enterprise-level clients. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

<Accordion title="Receive and Make Phone Calls" icon="phone">
Awareness is growing that Voice AI is a powerful way to improve customer service and increase efficiency. Vapi can be used in a call center, or even tov build your own; automate customer outreach; by industries with historically lower service scores like health insurers, airlines, and banks; and more. Examples: [Outbound Sales](/outbound_sales), [Inbound Support](/technical_support)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add a voicebot to your website" icon="browser"> 
Use Voice AI to change how you engage with customers via your website. The voicebot can answer questions, book appointments, or take orders.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Build RAG Systems" icon="database">
You can easily plug your RAG system with Vapi through function calling or using a custom LLM implementation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extend using Function Calling" icon="square-phone"> 
You can use the function calling in OpenAI format to interact with APIs, databases, or LLM-based endpoints. [Function Calling](/call_functions)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Your Own LLMs" icon="brain">
You can create more advanced LLM systems and integrate them with Vapi using Custom LLMs. [Custom LLMs](/custom_llm)
