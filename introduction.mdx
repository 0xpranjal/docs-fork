Vapi lets developers build, test, & deploy voice AI agents in minutes rather than months — solving for the foundational challenges voice AI applications face:

<Info>
  Implemented from scratch, this functionality can take months to build, and large, continuous,

Vapi abstracts away these complexities, allowing developers to focus on the core of their voice AI application's business logic. **Shipping in days, not months.**
