### The Challenges of LLM Conversation

#### Introduction

There are different scopes of voice AI application complexity. Some applications are very turn-based (affording for delays, less interruption sensitive), while others require a rigorous & realtime, conversational agent (that nears being indistinguishable from a human in conversation).

### Framing the Problem

Writing a voice AI application from scratch is a difficult problem.

In software development, there are certain problems you can & _will_ want to solve yourself, & another class of problems that are so wide-ranging & complex that it is best to cutoff complexity by using a third-party service.

Replicating the nuances & complexities of human conversation is a deep rabbit-hole, & ...
