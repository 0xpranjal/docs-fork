You might be wondering... should I create an assistant using the `/assistant` endpoint and use its `assistantId`? Or can I just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call?

The `/assistant` endpoint is there for convenience, to save you creating your own assistants table. You'd want to use it when:

- You won't be adding more assistant properties on top of ours.
- You want to use the same assistant across multiple calls.

Otherwise, you can just specify the assistant configuration when starting a call.
