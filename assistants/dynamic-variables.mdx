Prompts, messages, and other assistant properties can be dynamically set when starting a call based on templates.
These templates are defined using double curly braces `{{variableName}}`.
This is useful when you want to customize the assistant for a specific call.

For example, you could set the assistant's first message to "Hello, `{{name}}`!" and then set `name` to `John` when starting the call
by passing `assistantOverrides` with `variableValues` to the API or SDK:

```json
{
  "variableValues": {
    "name": "John"
  }
}
```

## Default Variables

By default, the following variables are automatically filled based on the current (UTC) time,
meaning that you don't need to set them manually in `variableValues`:

| Variable    | Description                 | Example              |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `{{now}}`   | Current date and time (UTC) | Jan 1, 2024 12:00 PM |
| `{{date}}`  | Current date (UTC)          | Jan 1, 2024          |
| `{{time}}`  | Current time (UTC)          | 12:00 PM             |
| `{{month}}` | Current month (UTC)         | January              |
| `{{day}}`   | Current day of month (UTC)  | 1                    |
| `{{year}}`  | Current year (UTC)          | 2024                 |
