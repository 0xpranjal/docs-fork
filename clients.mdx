The Vapi Client SDKs automatically configure audio streaming to and from the client, and provide a simple interface for starting calls. The interface is equivalent across all the SDKs.

They also emit events like:

- `speech-start`, `speech-end`, and `volume-level` for creating animations.
- `message` for receiving messages sent to the [Server URL](/server_url) locally on the client, so you can show live transcriptions and use function calls to perform actions on the client.

The SDKs are open source, and available on GitHub:
