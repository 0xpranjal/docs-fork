The Vapi Client SDKs automatically configure audio streaming to and from the client, and provide a simple interface for starting calls. The interface is equivalent across all the SDKs.

<Accordion title="Events" defaultOpen={true}>
  - `speech-start`, `speech-end`, and `volume-level` for creating animations. - `message` for
  receiving messages sent to the [Server URL](/server_url) locally on the client, so you can show
  live transcriptions and use function calls to perform actions on the client.
</Accordion>

The SDKs are open source, and available on GitHub:

<SdkCards iconColor={null} />
