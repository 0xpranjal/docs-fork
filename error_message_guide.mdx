**Assistant-Related Errors:**

- **assistant-error**: This general error occurs within the assistant's logic or processing due to bugs, misconfigurations, or unexpected inputs.
- **assistant-not-found**: The specified assistant cannot be located or accessed, possibly due to an incorrect assistant ID or configuration issue.
- **assistant-not-invalid**: The assistant ID provided is not valid or recognized by the system.
- **assistant-not-provided**: No assistant ID was specified in the request, causing the system to fail.
- **assistant-request-returned-error**: Communicating with the assistant resulted in an error, possibly due to network issues or problems with the assistant itself.
- **assistant-request-returned-invalid-assistant**: The assistant returned an invalid response or failed to fulfill the request properly.
- **assistant-request-returned-no-assistant**: The assistant didn't provide any response or action to the request.
- **assistant-request-returned-forwarding-phone-number**: The assistant triggered a call forwarding action, ending the current call.
- **assistant-ended-call**: The assistant intentionally ended the call based on the user's response.

**Pipeline and LLM Errors:**

These errors relate to issues within the AI processing pipeline or the Large Language Models (LLMs) used for understanding and generating text:

- **pipeline-error-***: Various error codes indicate specific failures within the processing pipeline, such as function execution, LLM responses, or external service integration. Examples include OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Together AI, and several other LLMs or voice providers.
- **pipeline-error-first-message-failed:** The system failed to deliver the first message. This issue usually occurs when you add your own provider key in the voice section. It may be due to exceeding your subscription or quota limit.
- **pipeline-no-available-llm-model**: No suitable LLM was available to process the request.

**Call and Connectivity Issues:**

- **twilio-failed-to-connect-call**: The Twilio service, responsible for managing calls, failed to establish a connection.
